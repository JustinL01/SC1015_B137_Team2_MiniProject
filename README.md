# Hotel Reservation Dataset

# About


This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on hotel reservations from the Hotel Reservations Dataset.

# Problem Definition

-Whether we can predict if someone will cancel their hotel reservation, and if we can identify key factors that contribute to the cancellation of reservations

-Which machine learning technique is the most optimal for the prediction of booking cancellations

# Motivation

-Ensure hotels optimise their operations and minimise losses due to cancellations

-Help hotels proactive measures to reduce cancellations and improve customer satisfaction. Ultimately, to gain more profits. 

# Machine Learning Techniques used

1.Multivariate linear regression

2.Logistic regression

3.K-nearest-neighbour (KNN)

4.Decision Tree and Confusion Matrix

5.Random Forest Classification


# Conclusion

-Individual variables have low correlation with booking_status, multiple variables have to be used to get good predictions

-Removing certain variables helped improve our techniques' accuracy

-Multivariate Linear regression do not work well with predicting Binary data

-Logistic regression do not perform well with non-linearly correlated variables

-Random Forest Classification can be used to find which variables are the best predictors

-The best variables to be used for predicting booking_status are the average price per room and lead time


# What did we learn from the project
-New Machine learning techniques like Multivariate linear regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest-Neighbour and Random Forest

-Handling imbalanced datasets using random forest

-Concepts about F1 Score and accuracy

-Follow a systematic approach and not based on our intuition

-Collaborating using GitHub and Google Colaboratory
